Then input your project name and organization (you can set it as No organization) then click **CREATE**.

**NOTE:** If you have a project already you can skip the above steps. And just select your current project name created previously.

It seems they need verification so for now to continue with this tutorial I will click the External because the Internal is not yet available for this account I'm using.

If your account is new you need to finish the OAuth consent screen and provide the important details they ask for.

Once the consent is finished then we will go back to the Credentials.
